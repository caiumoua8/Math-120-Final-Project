In - Depth Text Analysis on Blonde by Frank Ocean by Caiu Moua

**Summary: 
**
This project does an in depth analysis on the lyrics in Frank Ocean's album "Blonde". The main things be analyzed are his word choice, the emotions he portrays, and the album as a whole. This is being done because, in my personal opinion, "Blonde" is a perfect example of a modern day classic album. It has 10 years of age and is still one of the most listened albums in the world today.

The line graph will show the overall sentiment of the whole album. 
The bar graph is the overall emotion of the album. 
Then the tables showcase the main emotion for each song.
